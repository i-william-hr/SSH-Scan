# SSH-Scan
This script scans a specified IPv4 range and attempts to login with a set key and a username - I wrote it as i forgot where in a providers /24 my server was.

Edit to adapt path to SSH key, then run as "./ssh.sh 185.123.123.0 root" - Tested on macOS 15 as non-root.

No IPv6 support at this time.
